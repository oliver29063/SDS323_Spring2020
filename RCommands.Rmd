## Chapter 2: Introduction to R

To create a vector of numbers, we use the function `c()`. We can save things with either `<-`. In addition, we use `[]` as index brackets, which start at `1`, not `0`. The function `length()` shows us the size of a 1D vector. Meanwhile, the `ls()` function allows us to see all objects. `rm()` deletes unnecessary objects. Examine the example code and its outputs below.
```{r}
x1 <- c(1,3,2,5)
c(2,4,6,2) -> x2
y <- c(2,7,4,1)
cat(' The value of x1 is:',x1,'\n','The value of x2 is:',x2,'\n','The value of y is:',y)
x1[2]
```



The `matrix()` function creates a matrix of numbers.


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
